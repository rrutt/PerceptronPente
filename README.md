# Perceptron Pente

_Version 1.0.0+20250514  ([Version Release Notes](#ReleaseNotes))_ 

**Perceptron Pente** is an open source implementation of the **Pente** board game that uses neural network artificial intelligence pattern matching.

_(More details to follow...)_

## About the Software

The software is a self-contained executable program, written in **[Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/)**, that runs on Microsoft Windows or Ubuntu Linux (and presumably other Linux distributions).
(No separate run-time environment is required to run the program.)
The **[Lazarus Integrated Development Environment](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/)** was used to develop the program.
(Both Free Pascal and the Lazarus IDE are free open-source software products.) 

## Downloading and Running the Program

### Microsoft Windows

You can run the Pascal Pente program on Microsoft Windows as follows:

- Download the **PerceptronPente.exe** binary executable file from the **bin** sub-folder from this GitHub.com page.

- To uninstall the program, simply delete the **PerceptronPente.exe** file.

### Ubuntu Linux

You can run the Pascal Pente program on Ubuntu Linux (and presumably other Linux distributions) as follows:

- Download the **PerceptronPente** binary executable file (with no file extension) from the **bin** sub-folder from this GitHub.com page.

- Ensure the **PerceptronPente** file has the executable permission.  From a Files window, right-click the file, select Properties, and use the Permissions tab to enable the Execute permission.  To do this in a Terminal window, use the following command:
  
    chmod +x PerceptronPente

- To uninstall the program, simply delete the **PerceptronPente** binary executable file.

### Running the Program

Double-click the downloaded copy of **PerceptronPente.exe** (on Windows) or **PerceptronPente** (on Linux) to start the simulation.

When the program starts it displays the **Perceptron Pente** form.

Here is an image of the Pascal Pente form during a game

## Source code compilation notes

Download the **Lazarus IDE**, including **Free Pascal**, from  here:

- **<https://www.lazarus-ide.org/index.php?page=downloads>**

After installing the **Lazarus IDE**, clone this GitHub repository to your local disk.
Then double-click on the **src\PerceptronPente.lpr** project file to open it in **Lazarus**. 

_**Note:**_ Using the debugger in the **Lazarus IDE** on Windows 10 _**might**_ require the following configuration adjustment:

- **[Lazarus - Windows - Debugger crashing on OpenDialog](https://www.tweaking4all.com/forum/delphi-lazarus-free-pascal/lazarus-windows-debugger-crashing-on-opendialog/)**

When **Lazarus** includes debugging information the executable file is relatively large.
When ready to create a release executable, the file size can be significantly reduced by selecting the menu item **Project | Project Options ...** and navigating to the **Compile Options | Debugging** tab in the resulting dialog window.
Clear the check-mark from the **Generate info for the debugger** option and then click the **OK** button.
Then rebuild the executable using the **Run | Build** menu item (or using the shortcut key-stroke _**Shift-F9**_).
